# Multi_MCTS_Guidance_Separation_Assurance

A Python implementation of the algorithm proposed in paper "Scalable Multi-Agent Computational Guidance with Separation Assurance for Autonomous Urban Air Mobility Operations" by [Xuxi Yang](https://xuxiyang1993.github.io/) and [Peng Wei](https://web.seas.gwu.edu/pwei/).

A short video demo of this algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cbRUig4G_I&t=

## Requirements

* python 3.6
* numpy
* gym
* collections
* shapely


## Optional arguments


`--save_path` the path where you want to save the output

`--seed` seed of the experiment

`--render` if render the env while running exp


## MCTS Algorithm
The code MCTS algorithm is under the directory `MCTS/`

`common.py` defines the general MCTS node class and state class

`nodes*.py` defines the MCTS node class and state class specifically for Multi Agent Aircraft Guidance proble, e.g., given current aircraft state and current action, how to decided the next aircraft state

`search_multi.py` describes the search process of MCTS algorithm

## A2C Algorithm
To run the Multi-agent A2C algorithm, run the following code

```
cd A2C
python A2C.py --train
```

The `A2C_Agent.py` defines the agent that makes decisions where a neural network model is defined. Note this algorithm is not working properly. Also the reward function needs to be tuned in config file line 54 https://github.com/xuxiyang1993/Multiagent_collision_avoidance/blob/master/Simulators/config_vertiport.py

## Simulator
The simulator code is `MultiAircraftVertiportEnv.py`. The following described the main function in this simulator.

`config_vertiport.py` defines the configurable parameters of the simulator. For example, airspace width/length, number of aircraft, scale (1 pixel = how many meters), conflict/NMAC distance, cruise/max speed of aircraft, heading angle change rate of aircraft, number simulations and search depth of MCTS algorithm, vertiport location, ...

* `__init__()` initilize the simulator by generating vertiports, centralized controller, loading configuration parameters, generating aircraft.

* `reset()` will reset the number of conflicts/NMACs to 0 and reset the aircraft dictionary. Note here all the aircraft objects are stored in the `AircraftDict` class, where we can add/remove aircraft from it, and get aircraft object by id.

* `_get_ob()` will return the current state, which is n by 8 matrix, where n is the number of aircraft. Each aircraft has (x, y, vx, vy, speed, heading, gx, gy) state information.

* `_get_normalized_ob()` will normalized the state to be in range [0, 1], which will be useful if we want to feed state into a neural network.

* `step()` will return next state, reward, terminal, info given current state and current action. Each aircraft will fly according the given action. We have a clock at each vertiport to decide whether to generate new flight request/aircraft.

* `_terminal_reward()` will return the reward function for current state. This function will check if there is any conflict/NMAC between any two aircraft and update conflict/NMAC number. It will also remove aircraft that reaches goal position and aircraft pair that has NMAC.

* `render()` will visualize all of the current aircraft and vertiport. I used this to generate the demo video.
